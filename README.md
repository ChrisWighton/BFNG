# BFNG - Big Fuck-Off Nerf Gun
* * *

A Nerf / Arduino project brought to you by:
* James **For**mica &
* Chris Wigh**ton**

### Who we is?

This awesome duo combines to create **Forton Labs**. With their minor to fuck all experience in these types of projects they bring with them a Software and Mechanical engineering background fueled by a passionate love for all things orange and yellow.

Let me ask you a question folks, what do you get when you cross:

I'll tell you... SOMETHING COOL! Well at least, thats what we hope :)

### What we is gonna do

See the idea here is to create a controllable Nerf turret via a website for all sorts of silly activities. We'll be using a REST API to send commands to the VULCAN OF DOOM to control it's position and when to fire.

Later down the track we plan to turn this into a game of sorts with two of these bad boys connected and battling it out in a *last man stands* sort of fashion complete with power-ups!

This will be our first major project using Arduino boards so it wont be the fastest of builds but fear not, for it shall be a glorious day when we unleash this hell raiser upon this Earth!!!

### What we is gonna use
This is a list of the stuff involved in making this project happen (will be updated as we go)
* Nerf gun (Vulcan)
* Arduino Yun
* Metal and stuff
* Resistors and components and stuff
* Wires and stuff
* Swag and yolo bruh
